 Use of Statistics and R
---
## Background

The MechaCar, AutosRUs' newest prototype, is experiencing production issues that are impeding the manufacturing team's progress. Upper management at AutosRUs has asked Jeremy and the data analytics team to review production data for insights that can help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge we will:

* Conduct multiple linear regression analysis to determine which variables in the dataset predict MechaCar prototype mpg.
* Compile summary data on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of suspension coils from manufacturing lots.
* Use t-tests to see if the manufacturing lots differ statistically from the average population.
* Create a statistical study to compare the performance of MechaCar vehicles to other manufacturers' vehicles.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

With multiple linear regression, we find which variables (vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, AWD, and vehicle length) predict MechaCar prototype mpg. We're asking if MechaCar prototype factors affect mpg.

Hypothesis established using multiple linear regression model:

`H0`: The linear model's slope is zero, or `m = 0`. Our linear model is a flat line with 0 slope.

`Ha`: The slope of the linear model is not zero, or `m ‚â†¬†0`. Our linear model is not really a flat line with a slope larger than 0.

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

To discover whether variables affect `mpg` non-randomly, we must examine their `p-values`. If the `p-value is < 0.05`, random variance to the linear model is unlikely, implying those variables affect `mpg`. According to our results shown in the figure below, ground clearance (p-value = 5.21 x 10-8), vehicle length (p-value = 2.60 x 10-12), and intercept (p-value = 5.08 x 10-8) provided non-random mpg variance. When an intercept is statistically significant, other variables and factors that affect mpg are missing from the model. These variables may be in our dataset or need to be collected or observed.

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

To assess if this linear model accurately predicts MechaCar mpg, we must examine its r-squared and p-value. According to our data in the figure above, r-squared is 0.7149, indicating a strong positive linear association. This linear model accurately predicts MechaCar prototype mpg.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98360572/170603711-56b623b9-fca7-4503-bdca-75f54d3daa2e.png)

The MechaCar suspension coils must not have a deviation of more than 100 pounds per square inch, according to the design specifications. Existing production information meets this design standard for each and every manufacturing lot, individually and collectively? To what end?

There are no significant differences between the mean and median of Lot 1 and Lot 2 based on the design parameters. There is a lot of variation in Lot 3 compared to the manufacturer's specifications.

### 3.1 write an RScript using the `t.test()` function to determine if the PSI across all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

#### Code
```
# 3.1 t-test across all manufacturing lots against the population mean = 1500 PSI
t.test(suspension_coil$PSI, mu=1500)
```
#### Output

### 3.2 Write three more RScripts using the `t.test()` function and its `subset()` argument to determine if the PSI for each manufacturing lot is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

#### Code
```
# 3.1.1 t-test lot1 against population mean = 1500 PSI
lot1 <- suspension_coil %>% subset(Manufacturing_Lot=="Lot1")
t.test(lot1$PSI, mu=1500)

# 3.1.2 t-test lot2 against population mean = 1500 PSI
lot2 <- suspension_coil %>% subset(Manufacturing_Lot=="Lot2")
t.test(lot2$PSI, mu=1500)

# 3.1.3 t-test lot3 against population mean = 1500 PSI
lot3 <- suspension_coil %>% subset(Manufacturing_Lot=="Lot3")
t.test(lot3$PSI, mu=1500)
```


#### Output 3.1.1

It has been determined through data analysis that the two suspension coil lots with variation and standard deviation less than 100 pounds per square inch will meet the design specifications. Lot 3's variance and standard deviation, on the other hand, are larger than 100 pounds per square inch, so it fails to meet the design criteria.





## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Using a 93.972 percent confidence interval, we may conclude that the p-value for all lots is less than or equal to 0.06028, which is not statistically significant. There is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis based on this prediction. A statistically equivalent relationship can be found between the dataset's mean and the population's mean. It also appears that the suspension coils dataset is statistically representative of the population mean, according to the results of the investigation.


RESPUESTA ALTERNATIVA

The PSI values in Lot 1 and Lot 3 are not significantly different from the population mean. For lot 2, however, the p-value stands at.347, indicating that the suspension coil deviates from the population mean. The following are all of the t-tests:


## :four: Deliverable 4

### 4.1 Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

When shopping for a car, one of the aspects that consumers look into is the amount of horsepower that the vehicle offers. In my opinion, the consumer decision-making process is affected by three factors: horsepower, miles per gallon, and the size of the engine. We may utilize our experiments to determine whether or not our MechaCar is significantly different from the other vehicles in the competition. It is possible to form a null hypothesis, which would state that it is not distinguishable from the other companies, and our alternative would be the opposite of that. In order to accomplish this, we will have to apply our t-test once we have gathered data from a variety of various kinds of competing automobiles. Our t-test will include making a comparison between the populations of all of the different sorts of rival automobiles.


RESPUESTA ALTERNATIVA


The goal is to make the MechaCar car more efficient than current vehicles on the market. To achieve this goal, I believe that attention should be focused on increasing the MechaCar's fuel efficiency. In addition to the existing six variables examined in this study, further data must be collected for all MechaCar production designs. Weather conditions, such as wind speed and direction, rain, heat, and so on, might be added as well. Short and long travels, as well as fuel economy over time, must be taken into consideration when determining fuel efficiency. Comparisons can only be made with general market competition data.

Which metric(s) are you planning to put to the test, if any?
The following metrics will be met:

Numerical data is required for every information
As many data points as feasible will be collected.
Randomly chosen data samples are needed.
The data's standard deviation must be the same as
What do you mean by "null hypothesis"?
HO: In terms of mpg data, MechaCar's mpg dataset is identical to the competition's mpg dataset.

MechaCar's true mean mpg is higher than the competitor's true mean mpg.

What kind of statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis?? How come?
In order to compare our dataset to our competitors', I recommend using the t-test to do so. For this present analysis, the t-test was used and produced the predictions needed to move further.

A statistical test requires a certain amount of data.
There would be a p-value of 0.05. A p-value of less than 0.05 would indicate that the null hypothesis could be rejected and that the Ha is true based on the data. The MechaCar's mpg is predicted to continually outperform the mpg of its competitors if the Ha is accurate. Better fuel efficiency may not occur 100% of the time, but at the very least 95% of the time, there is opportunity for improvement.
